Why Our Lab Needs Version Control ðŸš€

Our lab is actively working with shared code, and we are growing every day. We constantly create new scripts, adjust existing ones, and develop new versions of Scanfold designs and other experimental workflows.

Currently, our documentation is very poor, and we often spend more time figuring out what was done, why it was done, and by whom, rather than actually using the existing scripts to improve or develop new ones. This has become a major drain on our lab's time, resources, and collective effort.




Using version control (like GitHub) helps us:


âœ… Collaborate seamlessly â€“ No dependency on a single person who wrote the code.

âœ… Keep everything documented & organized â€“ Any team member can update or review changes at any time.

âœ… Track differences easily â€“ We always know what changed, who changed it, and why.

âœ… Avoid confusion with multiple versions â€“ No more lost or conflicting versions of scripts and data files.


Even if it feels like overkill now, it's a best practice that will save us time, effort, and frustration in the future! ðŸš€
