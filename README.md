Why Our Lab Needs Version Control ðŸš€

In our lab, we work with shared code among multiple researchers, even though our work is not purely computational. We still rely on scripts, data analysis, and experimental workflows that evolve over time.

Using version control (like GitHub) helps us:
âœ… Collaborate seamlessly â€“ No dependency on a single person who wrote the code.
âœ… Keep everything documented & organized â€“ Any team member can update or review changes at any time.
âœ… Track differences easily â€“ We always know what changed, who changed it, and why.
âœ… Avoid confusion with multiple versions â€“ No more lost or conflicting versions of scripts and data files.

Even if it feels like overkill now, it's a best practice that will save us time, effort, and frustration in the future! ðŸš€
